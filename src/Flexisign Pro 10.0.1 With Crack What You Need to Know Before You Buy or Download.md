## How to Protect Your Friends List from Being Revealed by Facebook Friends Mapper
 
If you don't want your friends list to be revealed by Facebook Friends Mapper or any other similar tool, you need to change your privacy settings on Facebook. Here's how:

1. Go to your Facebook profile page and click on "Friends" tab.
2. Click on the pencil icon next to "Find Friends" button and select "Edit Privacy".
3. A pop-up window will appear, showing you different options for who can see your friends list and your people you follow.
4. Select "Only me" for both options and click on "Done" button.
5. This will make your friends list and your people you follow visible only to you and no one else.

Note that this will not affect your existing friends or people you follow, but it will prevent anyone from seeing who they are or adding them as friends. Also, this will not stop Facebook from suggesting your friends or people you follow to other users based on their algorithm.
