For areas that are vulnerable to water pollution, the best way to deal with domestic sewage from private residences is to connect to a reliable public sewer system that can treat and dispose of the wastewater safely. However, when this option is not possible or affordable, an alternative solution is to install an \*\*onsite sewage system\*\*  that can treat and dispose of the effluent on the same property that produces the wastewater. An onsite sewage system usually consists of a \*\*septic tank\*\* and a \*\*subsurface disposal field\*\* , where the septic tank partially treats the wastewater and the disposal field disperses it into the soil. The proper location and design of an onsite sewage system are crucial to prevent its early failure and to protect public health and the environment. A failing onsite sewage system can cause serious problems such as water quality degradation, nuisance conditions, disease transmission, and expensive repairs. There are two types of failing systems: those that are visible and odorous, and those that contaminate groundwater supplies with effluent before the soil can adequately remove harmful pathogens from the wastewater.

One of the most important aspects of owning and operating an onsite sewage system is regular maintenance. A well-maintained system can last for many years and provide effective treatment of wastewater. A poorly maintained system can fail prematurely and cause serious problems such as water pollution, health hazards, nuisance conditions, and costly repairs. Therefore, it is essential for homeowners to follow the maintenance plan and schedule recommended by the authorized person (AP) who designed and installed the system.

The maintenance of an onsite sewage system typically involves inspecting, servicing, and pumping out the septic tank or treatment plant, as well as monitoring the dispersal area for signs of failure. The frequency of maintenance depends on several factors, such as the size and type of the system, the number of people using it, and the amount and quality of wastewater generated. Generally, septic tanks need to be pumped out every 2 to 5 years, while treatment plants may require more frequent servicing. The dispersal area should be checked regularly for signs of ponding, wetness, odors, or vegetation changes that may indicate a problem with the system.

Homeowners should keep a record of all maintenance activities and receipts for their onsite sewage system. They should also keep a diagram of the system location and layout, as well as a copy of the operating permit if required by the local regulatory agency. These documents can help homeowners track the performance of their system and identify any issues that need attention. They can also help potential buyers evaluate the condition and value of the property if it is sold in the future.

Another important aspect of owning and operating an onsite sewage system is preventing and solving potential problems. A malfunctioning system can pose serious risks to public health and the environment, as well as create unpleasant and costly situations for homeowners. Therefore, it is essential for homeowners to be aware of the common causes and signs of onsite system problems and to take appropriate actions to address them.
  
Some of the common causes of onsite system problems include: excessive water use, improper disposal of household chemicals or garbage, lack of snow cover or plant cover, irregular use of the system, leaking plumbing fixtures or furnace drips, pipes not draining properly, cold air entering the system, and waterlogged system . These factors can interfere with the proper functioning of the septic tank or treatment plant, the dispersal area, or both. They can also cause freezing, clogging, or overloading of the system components.
  
Some of the common signs of onsite system problems include: sewage backup in drains or toilets, slow drainage or gurgling sounds in plumbing fixtures, sewage odors inside or outside the house, wet spots or ponding on the dispersal area, lush grass growth or vegetation changes on the dispersal area, and high levels of bacteria or nitrates in well water . These signs indicate that the system is not treating and disposing of the wastewater properly and that harmful pathogens may be contaminating the soil or groundwater. Homeowners should not ignore these signs and should contact an AP as soon as possible to diagnose and fix the problem.
