According to the patch notes[^1^], the update fixes missing weapon blueprints, optimises placement of collectible items, improves network stability and more. The patch also adds some new blueprints to the core campaign, which may require players to revisit previous areas to find them. The level cap has been increased to 60, giving players extra 10 skill points to spend.
 
This is not the first patch that Dead Island Definitive Edition has received since its launch in 2016. The game was originally released in 2011 and had several patches that addressed various bugs and glitches. The most notable one was version 1.3, which was the last official patch for Dead Island and was released on November 3, 2011[^2^]. The patch fixed problems with running the game on Steam in offline mode, damaged saves when a player had more than 190 items in inventory, duplicating weapons, random freezes when playing co-op and more.
 
Some fans have also created unofficial patches for Dead Island Definitive Edition, fixing some bugs that were not addressed in the official patches. One example is a patch by Tarizzjozaff on SoundCloud[^3^], which claims to fix issues with graphics, audio, gameplay and performance.

Despite the technical issues, Dead Island Definitive Edition still offers a lot of fun and content for fans of zombie games. The game lets you explore a huge open world island full of undead enemies, weapons, quests and secrets. You can choose from four different characters, each with their own skills and abilities, and customize them as you level up. You can also team up with up to three other players online and cooperate or compete in various modes.
 
The game has received mixed reviews from critics and players alike. Some praised the game for its improved graphics, gameplay variety, co-op features and atmosphere[^2^] [^4^]. Others criticized the game for its repetitive missions, weak story, buggy performance and lack of innovation[^5^] [^3^]. The game currently has a score of 71/100 on Metacritic for PC version.
 
If you are looking for a zombie game that offers a lot of action, exploration and customization, you might want to give Dead Island Definitive Edition a try. The game is not perfect, but it can provide hours of entertainment and challenge. Just be prepared to deal with some technical problems and glitches along the way.
