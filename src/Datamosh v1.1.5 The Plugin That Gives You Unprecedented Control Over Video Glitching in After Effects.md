## What is Datamosh v1.1.5?
 
Datamosh v1.1.5 is a plugin for After Effects that lets you create glitch effects by manipulating the I-frames and motion vectors of video files. I-frames are full pictures that are stored in video compression, while motion vectors are data on where pixels from previous frames should be moving.
 
By deleting I-frames and hijacking motion vectors, you can create amazing glitch effects that blend pixels from different clips, create distortions, artifacts, and digital noise.
